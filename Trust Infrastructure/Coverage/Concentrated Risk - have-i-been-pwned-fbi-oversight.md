This This is a legitimate defensive use case.

Its usefulness, however, does not eliminate governance questions.

It increases their importance.

The more valuable and widely depended upon the capability becomes, the greater the need to understand:

what information is transferred
how it is transformed
how provenance is preserved
how retention is governed
how deletion is handled
how access is audited
what happens after compromise or change of ownership
Receipt 03 — Genesis Market

The United States Department of Justice publicly stated following the Genesis Market operation that victim credentials obtained during the investigation were provided to Have I Been Pwned.

This is significant because the relationship is not established only through HIBP's own statements.

A primary United States government source publicly acknowledged the transfer.

InfinityGrid Finding:

E4 — ESTABLISHED

U.S. government-derived victim credential information was provided to HIBP for defensive notification purposes.

Receipt 04 — Qakbot

During the Qakbot disruption, DOJ identified HIBP alongside organizations including:

CISA
Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit
Shadowserver
Zscaler
National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance

as organizations involved in victim notification and remediation activity.

This demonstrates that HIBP's relationship with government cyber operations was not limited to one historical incident.

HIBP has become part of a broader public-private cybersecurity remediation ecosystem.

Receipt 05 — National Crime Agency Password Corpus

The United Kingdom's National Crime Agency provided HIBP with a major compromised-password corpus.

HIBP reported analyzing:

585,570,857 passwords

Of those:

225,665,425

were previously unseen by HIBP.

Those passwords were added to Pwned Passwords.

This further demonstrates that HIBP's intelligence corpus is not built solely from conventional corporate breach disclosures.

Law-enforcement-derived material can materially expand the service's defensive datasets.

The Oversight Question

The central InfinityGrid question is not:

Why does the FBI work with HIBP?

The relationship has an obvious defensive rationale.

The more important question is:

What formal controls govern the relationship after sensitive cybercrime-derived information leaves direct government custody?

The public record reviewed by InfinityGrid did not establish a detailed HIBP-specific framework describing whether or how the following controls operate:

mandatory independent security audits
FBI security assessments of HIBP
contractual security requirements
government audit rights
government-mandated retention periods
deletion requirements
incident-response obligations
FBI breach-notification requirements
subcontractor restrictions
change-of-control protections
continuity requirements
government exit provisions
formal service-level requirements
data-provenance audit requirements
periodic government reassessment
public reporting requirements

Again:

NOT PUBLICLY ESTABLISHED does not mean NO.

It means the public materials reviewed by InfinityGrid were insufficient to mark the control as established.

Oversight Matrix
Control	Publicly Established?
FBI / DOJ information provided to HIBP	YES
DOJ publicly acknowledges HIBP relationship	YES
Repeated government collaboration	YES
HIBP privacy policy publicly available	YES
HIBP publicly describes security controls	YES
FBI password-ingestion architecture publicly described	YES
Pwned Passwords open-source components	YES
Dedicated FBI-HIBP public contract	NOT ESTABLISHED
Dedicated public MOU	NOT ESTABLISHED
FBI audit schedule for HIBP	NOT ESTABLISHED
Independent audit results	NOT ESTABLISHED
Government-mandated retention period	NOT ESTABLISHED
Government-mandated deletion standard	NOT ESTABLISHED
Public change-of-control requirements	NOT ESTABLISHED
Public continuity / exit plan	NOT ESTABLISHED
Public security-incident requirements	NOT ESTABLISHED
Public subcontractor restrictions	NOT ESTABLISHED
Public annual reassessment	NOT ESTABLISHED
Security Controls Are Not the Same as Oversight

HIBP publicly describes meaningful security controls.

These include:

HTTPS
Cloudflare
API rate limiting
security scanning
Azure firewall controls
vulnerability disclosure
maintained third-party components
encrypted offline archival storage

Pwned Passwords also uses a privacy-preserving k-anonymity model.

InfinityGrid should acknowledge those controls.

But several distinctions matter:

SECURITY CONTROLS
        ≠
INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT
GOOD ENGINEERING
        ≠
GOVERNANCE
PRIVACY POLICY
        ≠
GOVERNMENT AUDIT
LAW-ENFORCEMENT TRUST
        ≠
PUBLIC CERTIFICATION

That distinction is the heart of this issue.

Government Data Does Not Stop Being a Governance Problem After Transfer

A conceptual data path looks like:

LAW ENFORCEMENT
       ↓
COMPROMISED / SEIZED INFORMATION
       ↓
PRIVATE EXTERNAL ENTITY
       ↓
INGESTION / PROCESSING
       ↓
VERIFICATION
       ↓
HIBP DATASETS
       ↓
PUBLIC / VERIFIED / API ACCESS
       ↓
INDIVIDUALS + ENTERPRISES + SECURITY PRODUCTS

Each transition creates a governance question.

Transfer

What categories of information can government provide?

Processing

How is the information transformed before use?

Verification

How is provenance maintained?

Storage

Where does source material reside?

Retention

How long can it remain?

Access

Who can retrieve archived source data?

Audit

Are access events reviewed independently?

Deletion

Can the original government provider require destruction?

Incident Response

What happens if HIBP itself is compromised?

Change of Control

What happens if HIBP or Superlative Enterprises is sold?

Continuity

What happens if the service disappears?

Data Retention Question

HIBP states that after breach datasets are processed and verified, source datasets may be separately archived.

The stated reasons include:

breach verification
re-verification
responding to legitimate third-party queries

InfinityGrid has not established that this retention is improper.

The important governance question is:

When law-enforcement-derived breach information enters an independent archive, what determines how long the original material should continue to exist?

Questions worth answering include:

Who authorizes retention?
Who can access archived source material?
Is archive access logged?
Is access independently audited?
Are retention periods defined?
Are different source categories governed differently?
Can the original provider require deletion?
What happens after a security incident?
What happens after ownership changes?
What happens if the operator closes the service?
Jurisdiction

HIBP's Australian ownership should not be framed as evidence of insecurity.

Australia is a close U.S. ally and major cyber partner.

The legitimate issue is jurisdictional, not nationalistic.

The question is:

When U.S.-origin investigative information is transferred to an independently operated entity incorporated under another country's legal system, what legal, contractual, and technical safeguards follow the information?

The same question would apply if the recipient were located in:

Canada
United Kingdom
Germany
Japan
another allied jurisdiction
Change-of-Control Risk

The public-private relationship should not be analyzed only under current ownership.

Trust infrastructure needs to survive organizational change.

Questions include:

What happens if Superlative Enterprises is:

sold
acquired
merged
restructured
placed into insolvency
shut down

Do government-originated data handling obligations automatically survive?

Can the FBI require deletion?

Can the relationship be terminated?

Can the data be transferred to a successor operator?

Are subcontractors permitted?

Are government partners notified before ownership changes?

InfinityGrid has not established public answers to these questions.

Continuity Risk

HIBP's success creates dependency.

That dependency raises a simple resilience question:

Could the government and the security ecosystem reproduce the defensive capability if HIBP disappeared tomorrow?

Continuity questions include:

Is there a replacement provider?
Are critical datasets portable?
Can government partners export contributed material?
Is there a succession plan?
Who owns continuity responsibility?
What happens to archived datasets after closure?
Can organizations continue compromised-password checks without HIBP availability?

This is not criticism of HIBP.

It is normal infrastructure-risk analysis.

Concentration Risk

HIBP's usefulness creates concentration.

Conceptually:

                     INDIVIDUALS
                         ↑
                         │
ENTERPRISES ←────── HIBP ──────→ SECURITY PRODUCTS
                         │
                         ↓
                 PASSWORD SYSTEMS
                         │
                         ↓
                GOVERNMENT REMEDIATION

The more security decisions that depend upon one source, the more important the following become:

integrity
availability
provenance
continuity
correction
governance
change-of-control protections

HIBP's success is therefore both:

a public benefit

and

a reason to examine systemic dependency.

Questions the FBI Should Be Able to Answer
Governance
What formal agreement governs the relationship?
Who approved it?
When was it last reviewed?
Security
Was HIBP assessed before receiving government-derived information?
Are security assessments repeated?
What minimum controls are required?
Audit
Does the FBI retain audit rights?
Are audits performed?
Are findings tracked?
Data
What categories of information may be provided?
Are raw credentials transferred?
Are passwords transformed before transfer?
Is provenance preserved?
Retention
How long may source information be retained?
Can the FBI require deletion?
Are different datasets governed differently?
Incident Response
What happens if HIBP experiences compromise?
How quickly must the FBI be notified?
What forensic cooperation is required?
Ownership

What happens if HIBP or Superlative Enterprises is:

sold
acquired
restructured
insolvent
shut down
Jurisdiction
What legal framework governs handling of U.S.-origin investigative information?
Continuity
Could the defensive capability be reproduced elsewhere?
What happens if HIBP becomes unavailable?
Questions HIBP Should Be Able to Answer

InfinityGrid is not asking HIBP to expose defensive secrets.

Reasonable governance questions include:

Do you undergo independent security audits?
Which standards apply?
How is government-sourced information classified?
How is source provenance preserved?
How are archive-access events audited?
What is the deletion model for source data?
What is the incident-response model for government-sourced information?
What happens after change of control?
What is the continuity and succession model?
How are incorrect breach attributions corrected?
How is confidence in breach verification documented?

Those questions can be answered without exposing operational security details.

What InfinityGrid Could Not Establish

InfinityGrid has not established public evidence showing that:

HIBP misused FBI data
HIBP sold FBI-supplied data
HIBP suffered a breach involving FBI-provided information
the FBI violated law by using HIBP
HIBP failed a government security audit
HIBP lacks internal security controls
HIBP operates without any agreement with the FBI
the FBI performs no oversight
no contract exists
no MOU exists

Do not convert lack of public visibility into an allegation.

The finding is narrower:

The public evidence reviewed by InfinityGrid does not currently allow the complete governance and oversight framework surrounding the FBI-HIBP relationship to be reconstructed.

That is the issue.

Why HIBP Became Trusted

Any credible assessment should acknowledge why HIBP became important.

HIBP solved a real usability problem.

Before breach-notification services became mainstream, ordinary users had little practical ability to determine whether their email address appeared in a known breach.

HIBP simplified that problem.

Pwned Passwords made compromised-password intelligence usable by developers and security products.

The API enabled automation.

Domain monitoring helped enterprises.

Law-enforcement contributions increased defensive value.

Network effects increased relevance.

Its widespread adoption was not accidental.

It was the result of solving a real security problem extremely effectively.

InfinityGrid Position

InfinityGrid does not argue:

HIBP should not exist.

InfinityGrid does not argue:

Government should stop collaborating with HIBP.

InfinityGrid's position is:

The deeper privately operated services become embedded in public cybersecurity operations, the stronger their transparency, auditability, continuity, provenance, and governance should become.

Final Assessment

The uncomfortable question is not whether Have I Been Pwned has provided value.

It clearly has.

The uncomfortable question is what happens after a privately operated cybersecurity service becomes sufficiently useful that governments begin providing investigative data to it and directing victims toward it.

At that point, the conversation changes.

It is no longer only:

Does the website work?

It becomes:

Who audits the relationship?

What requirements follow government-derived information?

Who verifies those requirements continue to operate?

What happens to source information after ingestion?

What happens after ownership changes?

What happens if the service disappears?

What independent evidence demonstrates that safeguards continue to function?

The absence of publicly located answers does not prove safeguards do not exist.

It means the public cannot presently reconstruct the complete safeguards from the public record reviewed by InfinityGrid.

For trust infrastructure this widely relied upon, that distinction deserves scrutiny.

HAVE I BEEN PWNED: TRUST BECAME INFRASTRUCTURE. NOW SHOW US THE GOVERNANCE.
InfinityGrid Principle

Trust is not an audit. Popularity is not oversight. Government adoption is not certification.

The same standard applies to InfinityGrid.

If InfinityGrid ever becomes infrastructure relied upon by governments, companies, security products, researchers, or millions of individuals, the public should demand the same receipts from us.
